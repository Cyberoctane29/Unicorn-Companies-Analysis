# Unicorn Companies Analysis
 This project explores data on unicorn companies—privately held startups valued at over $1 billion—to uncover trends in company growth, industry distribution, and geographic concentration. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization, it examines factors such as founding years, investment patterns, and regional dominance. The analysis incorporates datetime transformations, missing value handling, and categorical encoding to structure the data effectively for insights. Additionally, it identifies top industries, leading investor strategies, and high-valuation regions, providing valuable takeaways for investment decision-making.
